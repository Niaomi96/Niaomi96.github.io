  <h3>Genetics </h3>
  <h3>What is K Locus?</h3>
  <p>The K locus, is genetically know to transpire in the dog genome(DNA). 
     Which in returns  transforms  normally gray-coated color into  black-coated color 
	 individual wolves through natural  selection of course, studies  have also found this 
	 to play a role  in how wolves chose  a mate. If one wolf is kk(Gray) and the other wolf is  Kk(black), 
	 there pups would have better  outcome  to combating illnesses, and higher  rate for larger litter. However, 
	 if both wolves are kk, they will mostlikely have normal  size litter but will like lose their pups to disease, 
	 same goes for two  Kk, which in return  could create a lethal  KK, thus this pup  will mostlikely die in the womb 
	   or be conceived but would die, shortly after to terminal illnesses. K , scientific definition name is called, kurokami, 
	    which stands  for the Japanese  word for "black hair." </p>
 
    <h3>What happens if a wolf has  KK in genetics?</h3>
  <p>This will be fatal for well being  of  the pup,  it will not make  it to adult hood, this typically 
  happens  when a wolf has two Kk(black), it's  truly rare for KK to survive  to adult hood.
</p>

  <h3>What are genetic  pockets?</h3>
<p>In such rare cases  when wolf genetic population  drop so low that they, breed with the coyote to create a coywolf. 
This was located  throughout  eastern  northern  America, from Canada to south to Virginia, this is also know as adaptation to 
changing  environment. This is a primary  example  of genetic  pockets  or isolation of a population. This type of isolation  
limits the genetic  variation  of DNA  make up  in wolves, thus, this reduces  there chances of fighting  of diseases  or environmental changes 
 which this limits  the pack ability  to survive  in adverse climates. However, as individuals  we all know,  that animals  will adapt  and thrive
 to there environmental challenges, as that is how species evolved.</p>
  
  <h3> Which genetic  gene  is recessive or dominant?</h3>
<p>The different version genes  are called," alleles. Like  all living things,
 they carry two copies  of there parents unless they are parthenogenesis, which means it only needs one viable  
 parent to produce them asexually. This does leave the population at risk  of eradication of a disease  that they 
 cannot fight off expose it self within the population. Since wolves carry same allele, they are known  as," homozygous." 
 while if a wolf  carries two different  types alleles,  it is called," heterozygous." Dude to dogs cross  breeding  with the wolves, 
 they have brought  over there own genetic material known  as KB (Black), this making  dominant gene, since  wolves  carry Ky. What if it carry KBKy,
 it will just have two copies as KB, which is a form of a mutation. Ky is the recessive gene in wolf population. </p>

<div id="Wolfhabitat" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Wolf habitat </h3>
  <h3>What habitat wolves inhabit?</h3>
  <p>Wolves thrive  in forested areas, grasslands, steppes, tundra , boreal forests, deserts, and swampy areas.
</p> 

<h3>How far can a wolf species  range?</h3>
<p> A wolf packs territory  is as large as 50 square miles (129 square kilometers) or to over 1,000 square miles (2,590 square kilometers).
 Wolves can travel  up to five miles per hour (8 kilometers) , can reach up to speeds of 40 miles per hour(64 kilometers) an hour.</p>
</div>

<div id="WolfDiets" class="tabcontent">
   <h3>Wolf Diets </h3>
  <h3>What type of diet wolves have?</h3>
  <p>Typically  depending  on the wolf species, they eat, carrion,  small invertebrates,  fish, avian(birds).
  They also eat array of  wild berries and veggies. Type of prey they hunt, depending  on region  the wolf  calls its place  home, 
  they can eat, deer, moose, bison, elk, mountain  goats, reindeer, hares,  birds,  fish, etc. 60% of there diet consists of meat, as 40% 
  of herbivores  diet. So, in reality  wolves can eat just about  anything.</p>

<h3>Do some eat fruit/ vegetables? </h3>
<p>Yes.</p>
</div>

<div id="WolfNurseryRhymes" class="tabcontent">
   <h3>Wolf Nursery Rhymes</h3>
  <h3>Why are wolves viewed  as bad creatures?</h3>
  <p>Nursery  rhymes are fraction  of the reason  wolves are viewed  as bad animals. The largest  reason is due to fact that, has to do with centuries ago. 
  People was afraid  of  the wolf  howling, as it was strong and  ranged far, it could be heard  miles away  and be felt at your door step. The noise  
  it self given the residents the shivers or the idea that the beast behind the howl. The other reason behind this, was the theory  that wolves was killing livestock, 
  which gave it the reputation  of the tendency  to kill livestock, which in actuality coyotes /foxes was main culprit of killing  livestock . Another  reason, was installing 
  fear into generations , " If you don't behave, the wolf will get you!" Lastly,   individuals  coming  across  a wolf pack feeding, envision themselves  
  as prey(livestock) being devoured by wolves. Thus, this view was highly indicative towards  wolves, which prompted there ratification in the early in 1800-1900s, 
  the last wolf pack was slaughtered  unmercifully  in 1926, was enlisted in 1974, as endangered  as a mandate  to recover  the wolves of Yellowstone, however  
  they went extinct 1926, it was 48 years  a little to late, so they reintroduced  wolves from Canada in 1995 of January 12th.</p>

<h3>What is the likelihood of a wolf attacking a human?</h3>
<p>Rare, the only case of a wolf attacking a human was a 6 year old child , near Ivey bay, 
Alaska in April 2000, that was the last attack reported,  unless the individual is hunter, in natural order  of things, "an eye for an eye."
( I see this less a attack on people but more of a wolf defending it self.) Documation of 80 wolf- human encounters , 39 cases of aggression 
 among  healthy  wolves, 12 cases of unknown  illness  or rabid (Rabies, I'm surprised USA haven't dealt with rabies, like England did already. ), 
 29 cases of  fearless behavior  in wolves, 6 cases of healthy  aggression act, with people with dogs( Wolves, are more focused on the dogs,  as they 
 see them as rival  within there territory. As wolves are highly  territorial. ) 16 case of rabid, when wolves bit but none was fatal, 6 cases where bits was severed. </p>

<div id="Wolfspecies" class="tabcontent">
   <h3>Wolf species</h3>
  <h3>How many wolf species  are there?</h3>
  <p>There are 3 wolf species, canis lupus, canis rufus, and canis  simensis,  there are 38 subspecies which are cross between  dog and  grey wolf.</p>

<h3>Which one has the largest population?</h3>
<p>The grey wolf has the largest  population of wolves, ranging  from  200,000- 250,000s individuals. 
</p>

<h3>Whose endangered?</h3>
<p>Red wolf, abyssinian wolf, eastern wolf, dog, mexican gray wolf, northern eastern wolf,  eurasian wolf, arctic wolf,
 great plain wolf, Indian  wolf, northern rocky mountain wolf, interior  alaskan wolf,arabian  wolf, baffin  island wolf, etc.</p>

<h3>Whose extinct?</h3>
<p>Japanese  wolf, hokkaido wolf, cascade mountain wolf, Newfoundland wolf, African  golden wolf, steppe wolf, indian wolf, polar wolf,
 mexican gray wolf, red wolf, Ethiopian  wolf, etc.
</p>

<div id="Wolfhierarchy" class="tabcontent">
   <h3>Wolf hierarchy</h3>
  <h3> Do wolves have pack dynamic structure  or family oriented?
</h3>
  <p>Wolves have recently  been announced  as family-oriented pack back in 2018, as they have a breeding pair  known  as alpha ( Male and female). 
  However,  many people with structure packs, is trying  to  re-established that there is a hierarchy within  pack dynamic.</p>

<h3>Why do wolves show so much aggression  during feeding time?</h3>
<p>To establish who eats first, which typically  the alpha  pair and pups  eat first. Then the other members,  which has a feeding  structure as well, 
typically  the order is after alpha and pups,  it is beta & Gemma,  omega (subordinate) eat last. Feeding  time is also time  for one to establish  dominance 
and authority over others,  that's why have aggressive feedings. Which  very much contradict the no hierarchy within a pack, all group animals,  including us humans,  
have a  hierarchy,  such  as democracy or matriarch.</p>

<div id="Wolveshowls" class="tabcontent">
   <h3>Wolves howls</h3>
  <h3>What are different types of  howls?</h3>
  <p>Wolves have 21 different  howl dialects species  world wide.  Main howls of the gray wolf, Territorial howl, mate howl, individual howls.
</p>

<h3>Are they unique  for each  individual wolf?</h3>
<p> Yes, each individual  wolf has it's own unique howl, this is one of the ways wolves identify one another. </p>
